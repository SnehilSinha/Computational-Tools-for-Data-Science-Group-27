This project evaluates several text-similarity methods: Minhashing, TF-IDF, clustering, and sentence embeddings for their effectiveness in detecting plagiarism in short written answers. Using a structured dataset containing original and variously modified texts, we compare how well each representation captures direct copying and different levels of paraphrasing. The findings show that embedding based approaches detect semantic overlap more effectively, while TF-IDF and clustering highlight broader structural patterns.
